<p align="center">Abstract</p>
<p>To assist breeders in making parental selections and tracking breeding materials within their breeding programs, we have developed maxPedigree©, a program for managing pedigree and trait data for cultivars and breeding lines. maxPedigree©  Vesrsion 1.0 is developed using JavaScript,HTML and CSS. The maxPedigree© interface reads data from CSV file and is able to pull the pedigree and trait information for visualization and application by plant breeders.</br> Click here for Version 2.0 :

</br>The current version of maxPedigree©  features:
<ol>
  <li>An interactive search, that will allow breeders to look up and visualize pedigree tree information. </li>
  <li> Phenotypic data for descriptors and agronomic traits established by the USDA for the soybean germplasm collection</li>
  <li> Exportation of customizable data tables with desired lines and trait data.</li>
  <li> Different color for parent gender (Blue for Male and Pink for Female)</li>
</ol>

<p>An interactive searchbar with data table, export and import feature</p>
